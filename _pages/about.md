Hello, welcome to my personal site! Although I am not an active blogger, I strive to update posts whenever I find interesting topics.

I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Mathematics, Zhuhai](https://mathzh.sysu.edu.cn/) at Sun Yat-sen University.

### Main Research Interests

Data analysis in interdisciplinary fields, mathematical modeling, development, research, and application of data-driven learning algorithms and their interpretability. My interests include, but are not limited to:

- **Robust Learning for Interpretable Models**  
  <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 0.15); padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">Affective computing based on EEG data with noisy labels</span>  
  _Example projects:_ [1](https://github.com/dykuang/BCI-Attention), [2](https://github.com/dykuang/EEG-based-affective-computing), [3](https://github.com/dykuang/SEER), [4](https://github.com/dykuang/EEG-classification)

- **AI4X**  
  <span style="background-color: #fff3cd; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">Deep learning algorithms driven by both data and traditional theoretical knowledge in interdisciplinary fields</span>
    - **AI4Health**

      My most recent postdoc was at the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/">Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences</a>, supervised by <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~michoski/Michoski.html">Dr. Craig Michoski</a>. I developed data-driven and deep learning algorithms for interdisciplinary applications. Some of this work evolved into solutions/services at <a href="https://sophelio.io/">Sophelio</a>.

      I was born in a small town called <em>Jiyang</em> in Fujian Province, China ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian%27ou)). My name comes from the first characters of my parents' first job locations. No matter how hard reality is, you can always decorate it with your dreams!

      I cherish my days at <a href="http://www.fjjoyz.cn/">high school</a>, where I met excellent classmates and inspiring teachers. My broad interests in science began there, attending clubs and competitions, which later influenced my academic choices.
